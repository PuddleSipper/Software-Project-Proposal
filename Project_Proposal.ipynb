    "# Project Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "What problem will your game/simulation address?: My game/simulation will address issues regarding the decline in videogame creativity with the rise of AI and will be an adventure platformer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirement outline\n",
    " - Inputs: Player inputs (WASD/arrow keys as movement)\n",
    " - Processing: Process player inputs\n",
    " - Outputs: Translate player inputs into movement/actions\n",
    " - Transmission: Data will not need to be transmitted\n",
    " - Storage: Save data will need to be stored\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional and Non-Functional requirements\n",
    "Functional:\n",
    " - Inputs and movement will need to feel fluid and mistakes should feel like the player's own\n",
    " - Obstacles need to feel challenging but possible, player's should feel rewarded for overcoming them\n",
    " - Challenges need to be fun to do, and should reward the player when they do something correctly\n",
    "Non-Functional:\n",
    " - The game should have little to no inconsistencies in its aesthetics\n",
    " - The game should be visually captivating, players shouldn't have to look at horribly made sprites or similar things\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation of existing Ideas\n",
    "Super Mario platformer series\n",
    "| Positive | Negative | Implications |\n",
    "| :------- | :------- | :------- |\n",
    "| - Iconic | - Hard to get licensing | - Have to make unique designs |\n",
    "| - Captivating visuals | - Repetitive (Can also be a bad thing) | - Have to make interesting level designs |\n",
    "| - Repetitive gameplay loop | - Limited Innovation | - Don't be too repetitive |\n",
    "\n",
    "Sonic the Hedgehog platformer series\n",
    "| Positive | Negative | Implications |\n",
    "| :------- | :------- | :------- |\n",
    "| - Iconic | - Bossfights are repetitive | - Certain games are easier to get licenses for |\n",
    "| - Unique designs for levels |  | - Platformer boss fights can have a wide range of variety and differences if done well, such as utilising environment |\n",
    "| - Repetitive gameplay loop |  |  |\n",
    "| - Easy to get license (Sega is very chill) |  |  |\n",
    "\n",
    "Hollow Knight\n",
    "| Positive | Negative | Implications |\n",
    "| :------- | :------- | :------- |\n",
    "| - Iconic | - Highly difficult due to amount of different functions | - You are able to add on to the base functions of a platformer to make it more captivating |\n",
    "| - Unique movement and attack functions |  | - Unique character designs can be implemented throughout the story |\n",
    "| - Unique bossfights |  | - Difficulty seems to scale with the more movement functions you add to the game, as well as harder level designs |\n",
    "| - In depth story |  |  |\n",

    "### Pseudocode and Flowcharts\n",
    "Pseudocode:\n",
    " Normal Levels\n",
    " -User inputs movement <br>\n",
    " -User attempts to beat obstacles <br>\n",
    " -If user fails obstacles, restart from beginning of level or at savepoint and repeat from line 2 <br>\n",
    " -Elif user fails obstacles, restart from beginning of level or at savepoint, provide assistance with obstacles if it is the tutorial and repeat from line 2 <br>\n",
    " -Else user passes obstacles, reward them with new ability and some currency and move to next level <br>\n",
    " -If user has all abilities, reward with just currency and move to next level\n",
    " \n",
    " Boss Levels\n",
    " -User attempts to fight boss (through unlocked abilities) <br>\n",
    " -If user fails, restart from nearest savepoint and repeat from line 1 <br>\n",
    " -Else user succeeds, reward with methods to upgrade, such as more hit points or more damage, reward with currency as well\n",
    "\n",
    "Flowcharts:\n",
    "Level_Flowchart.png - How levels may work\n",
    "\n",
    "Bossfight_Flowchart.png - Similar to levels, but with different rewards at the end\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storyboarding\n",
    "Refer to \"Simple_Storyboard.png\" for the style of the game. <br>\n",
    "I want to make the game look similar to some old flash games like the Henry Stickmin series.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gantt Chart/Time Management\n",
    "\"Project_Gantt_Chart.png\" shows how I want to spend my time on this project, and will be a guide for what I should work on every week\n"
